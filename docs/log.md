o  Persistent using filesystem
    *  Design
    *  Write up file sys rationale
    *  Can we make the backing store test suite re-usable across any backend
       implementation?
        *  Remind suite facilities
        *  Regardless, how inject concrete type?
        *  Needs still be go test .
        *  Get it to work
        *  Comment properly and rename as necessary
        *  Ditch old test file
o  switch to doc.go
o  don't call it toy anything
o  say host should be host but can be just port
o  test docco in godoc
o  Tidy and make consistent all log messages
o  Test
    o  Consider which code usefully and pracical to test
    o  For resilience, and exemplars
o  should docco show install and run cli?
o  should docco explain about other language clients?
o  should docco show code examples
o  Update doc strings in API to sufficient quality for go doc being useful.
o  Add TLS / and or JWT auth
o  Package level doc.go
o  Containerisation
    o  Maybe seperate repo?
o  Orchestration / Hosted
o  Video / pitch?
