o  Persistent using filesystem
    *  Design
    *  Write up file sys rationale
    *  Refactor memstore tests into a reusable (for file store) suite also.
    *  Deprecate Create in favour of DeleteAll
    o  TDD filesystem solution using now-reusable test suite.



o  switch to doc.go
o  don't call it toy anything
o  say host should be host but can be just port
o  test docco in godoc
o  Tidy and make consistent all log messages
o  Test
    o  Consider which code usefully and pracical to test
    o  For resilience, and exemplars
o  should docco show install and run cli?
o  should docco explain about other language clients?
o  should docco show code examples
o  Update doc strings in API to sufficient quality for go doc being useful.
o  Add TLS / and or JWT auth
o  Package level doc.go
o  Containerisation
    o  Maybe seperate repo?
o  Orchestration / Hosted
