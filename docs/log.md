o  Persistent using filesystem
    *  bring in filenamer
    o  bring in a ioutils package
    o  resume testing at store method in suite test
    o  bring in index persister
    o  this test suite mo - not much good cos doesn't tell you where the

    o  augment test for with tests that close and repopen the store



o  switch to doc.go
o  don't call it toy anything
o  say host should be host but can be just port
o  test docco in godoc
o  Tidy and make consistent all log messages
o  Test
    o  Consider which code usefully and pracical to test
    o  For resilience, and exemplars
o  should docco show install and run cli?
o  should docco explain about other language clients?
o  should docco show code examples
o  Update doc strings in API to sufficient quality for go doc being useful.
o  Add TLS / and or JWT auth
